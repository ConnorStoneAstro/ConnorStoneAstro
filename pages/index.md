# Connor's Demos

From time to time I dive into some topic, and make a write up of my thoughts along the way. 
Here are some pages with those write ups!

- [Linear Regression Primer](RegressionColab.ipynb)
- [Bayesian Statistics Primer](BayesTheoremColab.ipynb)
- [Simulation Based Inference](SBIdemo.md)
- [World Coordinate Systems](wcs_demo.ipynb) (best if you run this one manually)
