# Hi There 👋 I'm Connor Stone, Ph.D.

I do research software development and statistics for astronomical applications.
I like to work in astronomical data processing where squeezing out the most
signal/precision/accuracy is critical to get science done! Lately I have been
involved in projects where we use GPU acceleration and automatic differentiation
to make powerful Bayesian analysis techniques possible. Check out the pinned
repos below.

## Research Software

I have written, or contributed to, a number of python packages for analyzing astronomical data (and other things) which I am proud of, take a look at them here:

## Mathematical Musings

From time to time I dive into some topic, and make a write up of my thoughts along the way. 
Here are some pages with those write ups!

[Mathematical Musings](pages/index.md)

### perfect is a score

Perfect may be the gradient of a log density, but life is Metropolis Adjusted
Langevin Algorithm.

<!-- Astronomical image processing tool. Lets fit everything everywhere all at once!
You can analyze multi-band, multi-epoch data with complex models where you are
in control of everything, it can even run on GPU. A special capability is that
you can fit a point spread function (PSF) model alongside everything else. This
means it's even possible to fit a PSF when there are no stars (or only very
faint stars) in the image! -->


<!-- Gravitational lensing simulator. Lets you build complex gravitational lensing
models and run them on GPU for 1000x speedup! caustics handles everything from
the source plane to the image plane by encoding complex raytracing capabilities
from numerous literature sources. YOu can build lensing models in object
oriented or functional frameworks and easily adapt simulators to suit the needs
of your science. We are using it to bring machine learning to gravitational
lensing with precision cosmology meaning well defined uncertainties and rock
solid results! -->



<!-- Build scientific simulators in an easy object oriented format. caskade works
from the base of your simulation pipeline to turn complex workflows into simple
`f(x)` functions so you don't have to think about the details of integrating
with other tools (`emcee`, `scipy.minimize`, `Pyro`, `dynesty`, `torch.optim`,
and many more). All while providing extra functionality like linking simulation
parameters, and updating static/dynamic parameters. -->


<!-- Automated galaxy photometry pipeline. Automatically perform elliptical isophote
photometry on galaxy images. Using robust methods, AutoProf will take an image
and give you a surface brightness profile of a galaxy finding its own center,
orientation, sky level, galaxy size, and more. Compared to other isophote codes,
AutoProf can go 10x deeper thanks to cleverly combining pixels for enhanced
signal-to-noise. -->
